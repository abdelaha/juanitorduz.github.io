Summary: In this expository article I discuss the definition and basic properties of the Hopf fibration, with particular emphasis on Dirac-type operators induced, in the sense of Brüning and Heintze, by the Hodge-de Rham and spin-Dirac operators. In addition, we compute the Dirac-Schrödinger type operator introduced in my PhD thesis.

In this post I want to present some [notes]({filename}/documents/hopf_fibration.pdf) around the fundamentals of the [Hopf fibration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopf_fibration) \\(\pi: S^3 \longrightarrow S^2\\) which I started writing  during my PhD period at Humboldt Universität zu Berlin. First, I describe its definition and show that is a non-trivial map by computing its first [Chern class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chern_class). Then I give a detailed treatment of the construction of two important Dirac-type operatos: the Hodge-de Rham and the spin-Dirac. As these two operators commute with the \\(S^1\\)-action, I describe how to push them down to \\(S^2\\) trough the orbit map \\(\pi\\) inspired in the work of Brüning and Heintze.  

The following is an interesting animation of the Hopf fibration I found online:
