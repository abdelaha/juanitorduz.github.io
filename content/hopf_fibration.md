Summary: In this expository article I discuss the definition and basic propierties of the Hop fibration, with particular emphasis on Dirac-type operators induced, in the sense of Brüning and Heintze, by the Hodge-de Rham and spin-Dirac operators. In addition, we compute the Dirac-Schrödinger type operator introduced in my PhD thesis. (In preparation ...)
