Authors: Juan Camilo Orduz
Summary: In this expository article we discuss the fundamentals of the Hop fibration with particular emphasis on the Dirac-type operators induded, in the sense of Brüning and Heintze, by the Hodge-de Rham and spin-Dirac operator. In addition, we compute the Dirac-Schrödinger type operator introduced in my PhD thesis.
